# Password Generator

The programme is a simple password manager written in Python. It allows the user to generate, view and save passwords in a text file. The program consists of several functions, such as generating a password, reading previously generated passwords, updating the number of available characters, taking input from the user and displaying a simple menu. It runs in an infinite loop where the user can choose from three options: generating a new password, reviewing existing passwords and terminating the programme. The generated passwords are stored in the file 'generated_passwords.txt'.

Validation is a key function in the programme and includes such cases as:

-user input of non-numerical values

-user input of values outside the given range

On the other hand, if the sum of the inputs of the 4 password questions is less than the user's answer regarding the length of the password, the program adds the appropriate number of lowercase letters to the password.

The task can be done in much less code by using the Random library.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you must have Visual Studio Code or another preferred IDE for Python installed. Configure the IDE for Python, translate the code into machine language i.e. compile it, and then run the program.
